## üìç Task:

Using API [covidtracker.bsg.ox.ac.uk](https://covidtracker.bsg.ox.ac.uk/about-api) get all data about ‚ÄúCountry data for a specific day" for current year and 10 any countries and store it into your DB: date_value, country_code, confirmed, deaths, stringency_actual, stringency. Output the data by date (the date is set) in form of a table and sort them by deaths in ascending order
